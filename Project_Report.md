**Project Overview**

This project explores credit usage behavior using SQL and Python. The dataset contains customer-level information such as credit consumption, upgrade patterns, and demographic details. The focus is on data preparation, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to build a foundation for predictive modeling of default events.

**motivation**

Predicting default risk is one of the most important challenges in financial services. By identifying customers who are more likely to default, businesses can:  
-Reduce financial losses through early intervention  
-Adjust credit limits and interest rates based on risk  
-Improve customer segmentation for responsible lending
-Strengthen compliance with risk management regulations   
This project demonstrates how to transform raw credit usage data into clean, interpretable, and predictive features that can serve as inputs for machine learning models.

2. Data Description

This project analyzes the data for a LendTech company. The table has 80K rows with these columns:



Key variables and what they represent

Any cleaning/preprocessing steps

3. Business Problem / Use Case

Define the business question(s) your SQL queries address

Example:

Which customer groups are most likely to default?

How do repayment patterns differ across segments?

Why this matters to a company

4. Methodology

How you approached the analysis

Which SQL techniques you used (joins, window functions, aggregations, etc.)

Any assumptions you made

5. Analysis & Findings

Present insights from your queries (in words, not just SQL)

Use simple tables or even charts (you can save them as .png in a /docs folder and embed them in Markdown like ![Alt text](docs/plot.png))

Connect each insight back to the business case

6. Business Implications

What actions could a company take based on your findings?

Example: “Customers with late payments in the first 3 months are X% more likely to default. Lenders should implement early-warning systems.”

7. Limitations & Next Steps

Be honest about what your analysis can’t do (e.g., limited dataset, SQL only, no predictive modeling yet)

Suggest what could be added if you had more time/resources

8. Conclusion

Wrap up in 3–4 sentences: what you found, why it’s important, and how it could be used in a real business context
